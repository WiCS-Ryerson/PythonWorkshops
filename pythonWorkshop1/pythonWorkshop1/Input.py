# Developers often have a need to interact with users, either to get data or to provide some sort of result. 

# Most programs today use a dialog box as a way of asking the user to provide some type of input.


# input ()

# input ( ) : This function first takes the input from the user and then evaluates the expression, which means Python automatically identifies that the user has entered a string.

# If the input provided is not correct then either syntax error or exception is raised by python.

# For Example:

# name=input("Enter your name : ")
# print(name)

# print("type of name : ", type(name))

# number=input("Enter a number: ")
# print(number)
# print("type of number: ", type(number))

# x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# print("type of number: ", type(x))

##Exercise: Ask for the users name and print it
# print("Enter your name:")
# x=input()
# print("Hello, " + x)
