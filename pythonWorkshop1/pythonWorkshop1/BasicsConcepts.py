# Syntax  --> 

# The Syntax of a language defines which strings of characters and symbols are well formed.

# Different programming languages have different syntax.

# For example :

# In C language:
# include <stdio.h>
# int main()
# {
# printf("Hello World ");
# return 0;
# }


# In Python:
  
# print("Hello World !!")

# Every language has :
# a good syntax 
#  
# x=3
# a bad syntax 
# 3=x
#
