# Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.
# 
# Objects are the core things that the Python pragrams manipulate 
# 
# Every object has a type.

# There are two types :
# Scalar
# Non-Scalar

# 1) Scalar Type 
#  Python has four types of scalar objects:
# 
# int: Positive or negative whole numbers (without a fractional part) 
# For example: -10, 10, 456, 4654654.
# print(3,type(3))
# # print(4)
# print(-10)

# float: Any real number with a floating-point       representation in which a fractional component is denoted by a decimal symbol or scientific notation 
# For example: 1.23, 7.659076
# 
# print(3.56)

# bool: Data with one of two built-in values True or False. 
# 
# print(True)
# print(False)

# None: The None represents the null object in Python. A None is returned by functions that don't explicitly return a value.
# For example:
# print(None)

# 2) Non-Scalar Type
# 
# For example:
# Strings
# print("abc")
