# Developers often have a need to interact with users, either to get data or to provide some sort of result. 

# Most programs today use a dialog box as a way of asking the user to provide some type of input.


# input ()

# input ( ) : This function first takes the input from the user and then evaluates the expression, which means Python automatically identifies whether user entered a string or a number or list. 

# If the input provided is not correct then either syntax error or exception is raised by python.

# For Example:
 
# number=input("Enter a number: ")
# print(number)

# name=input("Enter your name : ")
# print(name)

# print("type of number: ", type(number))

# print("type of name : ", type(name))
